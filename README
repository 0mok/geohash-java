java code for geohashes
=======================

An implementation of Geohashes in pure Java.
The produced hashes, when using character precision (multiples of 5 bits) are compatible
to the reference implementation geohash.org.

You can however also encode Geohashes down to the full available precision of a long i.e. 64 bits.


Building/Testing the code
-------------------------

The geohash-java code can be built using Apache Ant or Apache Maven.
Ant targets that are available:

	- clean		# wash dishes.
    - compile	# compile the main source code.
    - test		# (default) run the unit tests.
    - jar		# pack a jar archive with the compiled class files.
    - zip 		# pack a zip archive with the compiled binaries, source code and all other files.

Maven targets are the usual suspects.
    
    - compile
    - test
    - package

TODO
----

Current development involves getting the following things to run:

-	a method to find the n closest hashes to any given point.


Last important changes
----------------------

Version 1.0.2
-------------

-   Merged Kevins [ktcorby] code that yields all the geohashes in a bounding box, at a given resolution.
- 	Merged Chris' [cchandler] code to encode and decode geohashes from a binary string.

Version 1.0.1
-------------

-   Fixed issue #2 from Github:
	- Neighbouring hashes can be calculated by using the getAdjacent() method, which yields a hashes 8 neighbors.
	- northern, eastern, western and southern neighbours can be determined using the respective methods.

-   Fixed issue #1 from Github:
	- A bug caused different hashes to be yielded sometimes.
