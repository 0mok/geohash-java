java code for geohashes
--------------------------------

This code implements the geohash library as seen in many other projects.

We will try to keep compliant to the spec such as defined here[geoash, wikipedia], wherever that is possible.
This library uses longs internally, so hashes can no longer be only multiples of 5 bits long. One can easily create a 11-bit bounding box and find 
neighbouring bounding boxes of it.

Currently heavily BETA and everything is still subject to change.
