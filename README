java code for geohashes
--------------------------------

An implementation of Geohashes in pure Java.
The produced hashes, when using character precision (multiples of 5 bits) are compatible
to the reference implementation geohash.org.

You can however also encode Geohashes down to the full available precision of a long i.e. 64 bits.


TODO
----

Current development involves getting the following things to run:

-	a method to find the n closest hashes to any given point.
-	find all hashes within a bounding box (possibly including false positives)


Last important changes
----------------------

-	Fixed issue #2 from Github:
	- Neighbouring hashes can be calculated by using the getAdjacent() method, which yields a hashes 8 neighbors.
	- northern, eastern, western and southern neighbours can be determined using the respective methods.

-	Fixed issue #1 from Github:
	- A bug caused different hashes to be yielded sometimes.
